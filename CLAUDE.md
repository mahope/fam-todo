# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

NestList is a private, web-based application designed to organize tasks, shopping lists, and daily chores for one or more families. The system supports both shared and private tasks/lists, with special features for adults/children and an intelligent shopping list with automatic categorization.

**Design Principles:**
- **Simple, minimalist, beautifully designed**
- **Mobile-first** (primary platform) with desktop support
- **PWA** with offline support, real-time updates, and infinite login sessions

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.6 (TypeScript) with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js for JWT-based authentication with RLS
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for live updates
- **PWA**: Serwist for service worker management
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for local development, Dokploy for production

## Important Git Workflow

**ALWAYS commit and push your changes after completing each command or task:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Clear description of changes"
git push
```

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start all services (DB, PostgREST, Realtime, Storage, Web)
docker compose up -d --build

# Start only web development server (if DB is already running)
cd apps/web && npm run dev

# View logs
docker compose logs -f [service_name]

# Stop all services
docker compose down
```

### Frontend (apps/web)
```bash
npm run dev    # Development server on :3000
npm run build  # Production build
npm run lint   # Run ESLint
```

## Architecture

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS). Key tables:
- `families` - Family groups
- `app_users` - Users with roles (admin/adult/child)
- `folders` - Organizational containers for lists
- `lists` - Task lists with visibility (private/family/adults)
- `tasks` - Individual tasks with assignments and deadlines
- `shopping_items` - Shopping list items with auto-categorization
- `shopping_dictionary` - Product catalog for autocomplete

### JWT Claims Structure
NextAuth.js provides JWT tokens with these claims:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "<uuid>",
    "familyId": "<uuid>", 
    "role": "ADMIN|ADULT|CHILD"
  }
}
```

### Service Ports  
- Web (Development): 3003
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- Socket.io Server: Embedded in Next.js

### Environment Setup
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - NextAuth signing secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Application URL (http://localhost:3003 for dev)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

### RLS Policies
Access control is enforced at the database level:
- Users can only access data from their own family
- Private lists/tasks are visible only to owners
- Adult-only content requires `role IN ('admin', 'adult')`
- All operations check JWT claims via `auth.uid()` and `auth.jwt()`

### Real-time Updates
Socket.io provides real-time updates for:
- Task status changes
- List updates
- Family member activities
- Authentication-based room management

## Development Workflow

1. **Database changes**: Run `npx prisma migrate dev` after schema changes
2. **API access**: Use Next.js API routes with NextAuth session
3. **Real-time**: Socket.io client connects automatically on authentication
4. **File uploads**: Use built-in Next.js file upload API for avatars

## Core Features (from PRD)

### User Management & Roles
- **Roles**: Admin, Adult, Child
- Admin can create families and users
- Role-based access control for lists/tasks
- Login via NextAuth.js with email/password
- Persistent login sessions with automatic renewal

### Lists & Folders
**Visibility levels:**
- **Private**: Only owner sees them
