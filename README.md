## üèó Architecture

### Database Schema
The application uses PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant data isolation:

- **`families`** - Family groups with settings
- **`app_users`** - Users with roles (admin/adult/child)
- **`folders`** - Organizational containers for lists
- **`lists`** - Task lists with visibility controls
- **`tasks`** - Individual tasks with rich metadata
- **`shopping_items`** - Shopping list items with categories
- **`shopping_dictionary`** - Product catalog for autocomplete

### Authentication & Security
- **NextAuth.js** with custom credentials provider
- **JWT tokens** with family and role claims
- **Row Level Security** ensures users only access their family's data
- **bcrypt** password hashing with secure session management

### Real-time Architecture
- **Socket.io** server for WebSocket connections
- **Room-based** communication per family
- **Event-driven** updates for tasks, lists, and notifications
- **Optimistic updates** with automatic retry on failure
